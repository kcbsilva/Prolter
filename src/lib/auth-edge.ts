// This file was primarily for Supabase edge function compatibility or a specific JWT setup.
// As we are moving to direct PostgreSQL and simplifying auth for now,
// this file is no longer directly used by the current middleware.
// It can be removed or adapted if custom JWT-based auth is implemented later.

export {}; // Empty export to make it a module.
